At this moment researchers are unable to use this point cloud Big Data to its full potential because of a lack of tools for data management, dissemination, processing, and visualization.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is a scalable (more data and users without architectural change) and generic solution: keep all current standard object-relational database management system (DBMS) and integrate with existing spatial vector and raster data functionality. Core support for point cloud data types in the DBMS is needed, besides the existing vector and raster data types. Furthermore, a new and specific web-services protocol for point cloud data is investigated, supporting progressive transfer based on multi-resolution. Based on user requirements analysis a point cloud benchmark is specified. Oracle, PostgreSQL, MonetDB and file based solutions are analyzed and compared. After identifying weaknesses in existing DBMSs, R&amp;D activities will be conducted in order to realize improved solutions, in close cooperation with the various DBMS developers. The non-academic partners in this project (Rijkswaterstaat, Fugro and Oracle) will deliver their services and expertise and provide access to data and software (development).</p>\n"

His PhD research was on scalable orthology-based cluster detection in fully sequenced genomes and on the integration of protein orthology/family data resources. In close collaboration with SURFsara, he used the Dutch Life Science Grid to compute a comprehensive map of corresponding (orthologous) proteins across species from all three domains of life.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 Arnold moved to Switzerland and joined the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Lausanne, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. He worked on an e-Science project aimed at speeding up the detection of positive selection in animal genomes using the Swiss Multi Science Grid (SMSCG).</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 Arnold returned to the Netherlands and carried out research in computational mass spectrometry(MS)-based proteomics at the Department of Genetics at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Here he focused on reliable MS-based detection of cellular responses (pathways) upon exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields. To facilitate the MS data handling and statistical analyses, Arnold developed the <a href=\"http://www.bioinformatics.nl/piqmie\">PIQMIe</a> proteomics web server.</p>\n\n<p>At the Netherlands eScience Center, Arnold works on the ODEX4all and candYgene projects, which involve Linked Data/Semantic Web technologies, worlflows and Big data analytics.</p>\n"
