In proceedings of the fifth ACM international conference on Web Search and Data Mining. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2124306</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The cross-perspective topic model is an extended form of Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). Topics are learned by doing LDA on the topic words (nouns) in\nthe corpus. Opinions are learned from a separate LDA process using opinion words\n(adjectives, verbs, and adverbs). A topic is a probability distribution\nover topic words. An opinion is a probability distribution over opinion words.\nWhile the topics are shared among the entire corpus, opinions depend on the perspective\na document belongs to. A document can only belong to a single perspective, and the\ndivision of the corpus in perspectives is fixed and must be known in advance.</p>\n\n<p>The imaginary process for generating documents is: one first selects a topic,\nbased on the topic mixture of that document. Then a topic word is drawn from the\ntopic. This procedure is repeated until all topic words have been selected.\nNext, one selects an opinion based on the frequency of topic words associated\nwith the topics in the document. The more words associated with a certain topic,\nthe higher the chance that the corresponding opinion will be selected. The\ncontents of the opinion (i.e., probabilities of opinion words) depend on the\ngenerator’s perspective. Next, an opinion word is drawn from the selected opinion.\nThis procedure is again repeated until all opinion words have been selected.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>An eScience infrastructure for Bayesian inverse modeling</p>\n\n<p>We have developed a parallel MATLAB version of SODA (Vrugt et al., 2005) that makes use of MPI. The software package is called ‘The MMSODA Toolbox for MATLAB’, or MMSODA for short (MMSODA stands for MATLAB-MPI-SODA).</p>\n\n<p>MMSODA offers the functionality of a number of previously separate softwares, namely SCEM-UA (Vrugt <em>et al</em>., 2003b), SODA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2005a,b; Clark and Vrugt, 2006), MOSCEM-UA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2003a), multi-objective SODA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2008), the MPITB-parallel version of SCEM-UA implemented in Octave (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2006b), and the MPITB-parallel version of SODA implemented in Octave (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2006a). Additionally, MMSODA offers a parallel version of multi-objective SCEM-UA, and a parallel version of multi-objective SODA, both of which did not exist previously. Moreover, MMSODA does not use Octave when running in parallel, because Octave does not evaluate code as quickly as does MATLAB. MMSODA circumvents (in a legal fashion) the license requirements that are often an impediment to parallel computation by compiling the MATLAB code into a binary which can be run without any license. Compiling the binary, however, does require a license, both for the MATLAB program itself, as well as for the MATLAB Compiler Runtime Toolbox. Fortunately, the required licenses are available on most cluster environments targeting a scientific and engineering audience.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the acronyms mentioned above mean that: MMSODA can do parameter tuning with or without intermediate state updating by an ensemble Kalman Filter; that MMSODA supports both single-objective and multi-objective optimization; and that the optimization can be run either sequentially on a local machine, or in parallel on a cluster computer.</p>\n\n<p>The serial/parallel capability is particularly attractive, since it allows the users to set up their optimizations locally on their own machines, thus ensuring a familiar development environment without the need to make the code compatible with Octave syntax. When the user finishes setting up the optimization, running it on a cluster computer is simply a matter of copying the relevant directory to the cluster storage using standard tools (e.g. WinSCP) and compiling the software by executing a script that comes with the software. Furthermore, MMSODA is fully documented with HTML documentation which can be accessed in the same way as MATLAB’s built-in commands, namely through the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">doc</code> command.</p>\n\n<p><em>References</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>J.

It can be used to parallelize your code with minimal effort.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"why-noodles\">Why Noodles?</h1>\n\n<p>The primary goal of Noodles is to make it easy to run jobs on cluster supercomputers, in parallel, straight from a Python shell. The user enters a Python script that looks and feels like a serial program. The Noodles engine then converts this script into a call graph. This graph can be executed on a variety of machines using the different back-end runners that Noodles provides. This is not so much a design driven by technology but by social considerations. The end user may expect an elegant, easy to understand, interface to a computational library. This user experience we refer to as eating of noodles.</p>\n\n<p>The computational library that is exposed to the user by means of Noodles needs to adhere to some design principles that are more strict than plain Python gives us. The library should follow a functional style of programming and is limited by the fact that function arguments need to pass through a layer where data is converted to and from a JSON format. The design of such a library is the cooking of noodles. As it is with ramen noodles, ofttimes the cook is also an avid consumer of noodles.</p>\n\n<p>The complexity of running a workflow in parallel on a wide variety of architectures is taken care of by the Noodles engine. This is the production of noodles which is left as an exercise for the Noodles dev-team at the Netherlands eScience Center.</p>\n"

OpenDA wants to stimulate the use of data-assimilation and calibration by lowering the implementation costs and enhancing the exchange of software among researchers and end-users.\nA model that conforms to the OpenDA standard can use all the tools that are available in OpenDA. This allows experimentation with data-assimilation/calibration methods without the need for extensive programming. Reversely, developers of data-assimilation/calibration software that make their implementations compatible with the OpenDA interface will make their new methods usable for all OpenDA users (either for free or on a commercial basis).\nOpenDA has been designed for high performance. Hence, even large-scale models can use it. Also, OpenDA allows users to optimize the interaction between their model and the data-assimilation/calibration methods. Hence, data-assimilation with OpenDA can be as efficient as with custom-made implementations of data-assimilation methods.\nOpenDA is an Open Source project. Contributions are welcome from anyone wishing to participate in the further development of the OpenDA toolset.</p>\n"

You run the code a couple of times, each time making minor modifications. You come back to it the next week/month/year. Do you know how you created that graph? What input data? What version of your code? If you’re anything like me then the answer will often, frustratingly, be “no”. Of course, you then waste lots of time trying to work out how you created it, or even give up and never use it in that journal paper that will win you a Nobel Prize…</p>\n\n<p>ReciPy (from <em>recipe</em> and <em>python</em>) is a Python module that will save you from this situation! (Although it can’t guarantee that your resulting paper will win a Nobel Prize!) With the addition of a single line of code to the top of your Python files, ReciPy will log each run of your code to a database, keeping track of the input files, output files and the version of your code, and then let you query this database to find out how you actually did create “graph.png”.</p>\n\n<p>When you import recipy it adds a number of classes to “sys.meta_path”. These are then used by Python as part of the importing procedure for modules. The classes that we add are classes derived from “PatchImporter”, often using the easier interface provided by “PatchSimple”, which allow us to wrap functions that do input/output in a function that calls recipy first to log the information.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, ReciPy provides patches for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>numpy</li>\n  <li>pandas</li>\n  <li>matplotlib.pyplot</li>\n  <li>gdal</li>\n  <li>sklearn</li>\n  <li>nibabel</li>\n</ul>\n"

For tabular data, there are some tools available that facilitate data pre-processing, such as OpenRefine and Trifacta Wrangler. However, these tools one big disadvantage; they don’t scale to really big data sets. Also, Trifacta Wrangler is not open source. For full text data, no tools for data cleanup exist.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the data cleaning toolkit subproject is to create a data cleaning toolkit that is open source, supports both tabular data and full text pre-processing, and scales to big data sets. The frontend is a web interface that supports loading the data and creating workflows. Based on user input, it generates scripts that are send to the backend for execution. The backend relies on spark to ensure scalability.</p>\n\n<p>Because building a complete toolkit is is rather ambitious, we focus on the use case of vocabulary cleanup for full text data. When working with full text data, pre-processing often consists of tokenizing texts (i.e., splitting them into words), lematizing or stemming the tokens, and performing some kind of filtering to remove typo’s and other unwanted tokens. The data cleaning toolkit should support customizing these tasks, and provide visualizations that facilitate vocabulary cleanup.</p>\n"

For this purpose, there are also recipes for building conda binaries of <a href=\"https://github.com/rootpy/root_numpy\">root-numpy</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rootpy/rootpy\">rootpy</a>, the community-driven initiative to provide a more pythonic interface with ROOT on top of the existing PyROOT bindings.</p>\n\n<p>The most most important thing for making things work out of the box is the ABI (binary) compatibility between different gcc(libstdc++)/glibc library versions, on various linux distributions. Typically ROOT would even complain when the GCC headers are not of the same version as the one used for building it, so <em>shipping the full GCC and glibc as a run dependency</em> of ROOT, seemed like the best solution.</p>\n\n<p>Combine this with the fact that ROOT 6 requires GCC&gt;=4.8, while we want things to work on older platforms with no “sudo” required, <strong>we decided to fix our GCC distribution to (a relatively recent one) 4.8.2, built against a rather old glibc version 2.12</strong>, making it as cross platform as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Working ROOT has been tested on: Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, 14.04, 15.04, SLC-6.7, SLC-7.

      "description": "<p>55% of The Netherlands is below sea level. This area contains 60% of the population and generates 65% of the Gross National Product. Obviously, The Netherlands requires efficient risk and water management.</p>\n\n<p>Efficient risk assessment requires large-scale flood simulations with high precision in case a dike or dam breaks. Continuous monitoring of man-made infrastructures in search of small deviations or breaches. And impact assessment of urban area re-organization.</p>\n\n<p>For precise and effective risk assessment, we must increase precision in high-resolution flood simulations, improve accuracy of semantic trajectory determination of water channel networks, and provide the means to align and compare data sets at different resolutions to study the spatial evolution over time of an area or structure.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, current solutions, consisting of PostGIS combined with stand-alone applications and libraries, lack the necessary flexibility and scalability and require extensive preprocessing of the data. The goal of this project is to modernize generation and manipulation of these datasets by using a Geospatial Database Management System (DBMS). The unique advantage of this approach is that, unlike previous solutions, it stores the raw data sets, and transforms, combines and processes them only when needed. This will vastly improve flexibility and performance.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this goal the project team will extend a Geospatial Database Management System (G-DBMS) with a flexible storage schema for 2D/3D geospatial datasets (point cloud, raster, vector, etc.). This is used to store semantically rich objects needed for the personalization of 3D digital city models (i.e., data re-generation with user defined parameters). These 3D digital city models form the basis for flow simulations, urban planning and under- and over- ground formation analysis. Additionally they are very important for automated anomaly detection on manmade structures.</p>\n\n<p>In this G-DBMS, topological and geometric functionality for 3D raster manipulation will become first-class citizens. For near real-time 3D model generation and manipulation some of these operators will be complemented with a GPU version. Application specific functionality, such as constrained Delaunay triangulation and the marching cubes algorithm for surface re-construction, will also be added as they are important tools in the work done by our commercial partners.</p>\n\n<p>Within this project, spatial analysis tailored to different use case scenarios is done on demand and fast enough to be used by modern risk management systems to, for example, determine trajectory escape routes. In addition, it will provide the means to identify and quantify deviations on flow patterns, such as wind and water, while modeling under- and over- ground surfaces. In other words, it addresses the challenges identified by three major companies in the sector: Fugro, Geodan, and Deltares.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this project stands on the shoulders of a successful COMMIT/ project, “spatiotemporal data warehouses for trajectory exploitation” (P19), and the strategic partnership between CWI Database group, Netherlands eScience Center (NLeSC), TU Delft 3D Geo-information group, VU Geographic Information Systems (GIS) group and Geodan to develop core technology for “Big Data Analytics in the Geo-Spatial Domain”.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>Computing devices (including mobile phones) feature in many of the day-to-day crimes. Computer forensics has emerged as a discipline to assist law enforcement agencies in addressing the increasing use of digital storage devices in criminal acts. Forensic examination of for example mobile phones and personal computers can reveal a wealth of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, high profile criminal cases are benefitting from digital evidence gathered via a computer forensic examination. However, analyzing these large volume data sets of evidence can prove to be a very time consuming process due to the variety of the data and the quantity of potential evidence in a digital environment. For this reason, the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) designed the HANSKEN platform - an important aid in modern police investigation, capable of micro level analysis of digital traces contained in digital devices such as hard disks and mobile phones, and generating macro level forensic views.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-new-computing-paradigm\">A new computing paradigm</h1>\n\n<p>The HANSKEN platform requires a wide variety of computing hardware – all at once. The concurrent use of such variety of hardware has been applied in scientific and industrial applications, spawning a new computing paradigm: Jungle Computing. This variety of computing hardware used in Jungle Computing can take many forms – ranging from a single centralized machine consisting of heterogeneous hardware components (e.g., multicore CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs) to large-scale distributed systems consisting of combinations of multiple clusters, grids, and cloud systems (each potentially being self-heterogeneous as well).</p>\n\n<p>The complexity of Jungle Computing Systems has generated a need for programming tools that simplify application development and deployment. Above all, such tools must hide as much as possible the idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware. Moreover, such tools must allow programmers to efficiently integrate multiple compute kernels each potentially implemented using different languages or models (e.g. C, MPI, Python, CUDA), to easily combine and integrate different types of data (potentially from different locations), and to easily deal with dynamic computing needs (software malleability and scalability) and ad-hoc hardware availability (hardware malleability and fault-tolerance). This project focuses on the development of a high quality set of technologies that adhere to all these requirements.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-jungle-computing-version-of-the-hansken-platform\">A Jungle Computing version of the HANSKEN platform</h1>\n\n<p>The project aims to apply Jungle Computing to the above described extremely demanding domain of forensic analysis, in particular by extending and adapting the HANSKEN platform. Important requirements underlying the HANSKEN platform include: high-performance, full coverage of all available (possibly distributed) traces, ability to support a wide variety of trace analysis compute kernels, and direct access for various types of police investigators. Although the HANSKEN approach is proven successful (showing 80 times speed improvement over NFI’s current XIRAF system), the expected growth in data volumes, the need for multi-tenancy, and the need for deep analysis of multimedia traces in particular, put further demands on the HANSKEN platform. This proposal aims to realize a Jungle Computing enabled version of HANSKEN that adheres to all these requirements.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"providing-faster-insights-in-forensic-casework\">Providing faster insights in forensic casework</h1>\n\n<p>Driven by the demands of the forensic analysis domain, expected outcomes of the proposed project include:<br />\n - High quality releases of core Jungle Computing technologies, based on the Ibis system of VU University.\n - Optimized GPU implementations for a set of performance-critical multimedia analysis kernels.\n - A generic and flexible interface to analysis tools, toolsets and/or libraries for specific forensic analysis domains.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the collaboration between VU University, NFI and the Netherlands eScience Center, it is expected that forensic digital analysis will provide faster insights in forensic casework as well as new links between cases that would otherwise not have been found (for example cross-trace camera identification).</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>##The evolution of embedded star clusters</p>\n\n<p>The early evolution of star clusters is one aspect of the formation of our Universe which is not yet completely understood. When stars are born they develop from large clouds of molecular gas, clusters composed of hundreds of solar masses of material. Early in the formation of our Galaxy large clusters formed from giant molecular clouds. Each cluster contains over 10,000 members. These clusters, appearing very compact, contain the oldest stars in the Universe. Understanding the changes in their lifetime helps us understand the formation of our Universe.</p>\n\n<p>##Simulating the exact circumstances in the early Universe</p>\n\n<p>In the past decade, our picture of star and cluster formation has changed hugely and we now believe that many - if not most - stars form in clusters, and the process of star and cluster formation is extremely rapid and dynamic. Using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE), a simulation can be made that mimics the exact circumstances of such a cluster.</p>\n\n<p>AMUSE provides a homogeneous interface to a wide variety of packages enabling the study of astrophysical phenomena where complex interactions occur between different physical domains, such as stellar evolution and dynamics, (magneto-)hydrodynamics, radiative transfer, and astrochemistry. Applications are numerous. For example, AMSUSE enables studying the co-evolution of planetary systems within cluster environments, the formation and evolution of black holes in galaxies, or the interplay of gas, radiation, and chemistry in star formation process. These simulations lead to new understandings of the processes involved, and their effects on the current state of our Universe.</p>\n\n<p>The above is only one example of the possibilities of AMUSE. Based on the work done in the Ibis project at the VU University Amsterdam, we are building a robust, stable system for running these large scale simulations on a possibly distributed set of resources, including supercomputers. This will allow astrophysicists from around the world to scale up their simulations, increasing our understanding of the Universe.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>People are used to the stunning visual images taken by telescopes like\nthe Hubble or the great telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, but maybe only\nhave heard of radio astronomy through movies like “Contact”. But radio\ntelescopes can “see” regions beyond the optical view of a galaxy. They\ncan uncover the mysteries as to how the early galaxies, in the\nmillions of years following the Big Bang, began to evolve: Where did\nthey get their material? What drives their rotation? What has shaped\nthem?</p>\n\n<p>Since the 1930s astronomers have used radio telescopes to explore the\nUniverse by detecting radio waves emitted by a wide range of\nobjects. Our Sun, the nearest star to Earth is a powerful radio\nemission source, mainly due to its proximity to our planet, but some\nradio sources, which are millions of even billions of light years\naway, are truly colossal in terms of their radio output.</p>\n\n<p>Radio telescopes provide alternative views to optical telescopes. They\ncan detect invisible gas, and can reveal areas of space that may be\nobscured with cosmic dust. And unlike optical telescopes, which can be\nhampered by cloud or poor weather conditions on Earth, radio\ntelescopes, working with signals at a longer wavelength, can be used\neven in cloudy skies.Radio telescopes can, for example, indirectly\nmeasure the effects of gravity on objects in the Universe. Objects\nlike Pulsars, the fast spinning remnants of supernova explosions, and\ntheir more exotic cousins, the Black Holes, which are the densest\nobjects in the Universe, exert huge gravitational effects on nearby\nobjects.</p>\n\n<p>However, to discover these pulsars you need a high resolution radio\ntelescope; it would be kilometers across. For a single dish this is\nclearly not possible or practical. To get around this limitation in\nsize radio astronomers use astronomical interferometers; an array of\nradio telescopes linked together. In the Netherlands, the LOFAR radio\ninterferometric array is distributed over an area of about one hundred\nkilometers in diameter.</p>\n\n<p>The brute-force search for pulsars takes place over many parameter\ncombinations, because we do not know the position, distance and period\nof the pulsars. Searching for pulsars is a Big Data problem: typical\nobservations produce hundreds of terabytes, and petabytes of\nresults. Moreover, the pulsar signal is faint and can be completely\ncovered by Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), which has to be\nanalyzed and removed from the signal. In this project we aim to\ngreatly speed up the search for new pulsars by using Graphics\nProcessing Units (GPUs) for the complex computations. We are\ndeveloping a complete real-time pulsar searching pipeline using a GPU\ncluster, and are testing it with two Dutch radio telescopes: LOFAR and\nApertif. LOFAR currently is the largest radio telescope in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Astronomical processing software requires expertise from a variety of\ndisciplines The results of this work will be extremely important in\ndeveloping the hardware and software for what will be the most\npowerful radio telescope ever built, the Square Kilometer Array\n(SKA). The SKA will be three to four orders of magnitude larger than\nLOFAR; requiring exascale computing and networking, and the tools\ndeveloped in this project, to run efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>This project explores a new development model for astronomical\nprocessing software where expertise from a variety of disciplines is\ncombined. This includes for example mathematics for the foundations of\nnew algorithms, and computer science to optimize for high-performance\nplatforms. Optimized software and demonstrators will be developed that\ncan be re-used in a variety of contexts, not just for\nradio/mm-astronomy, but also in other areas where large data-streams\nare combined.</p>\n"

Urban scenes consist of large collections of complex objects which have rich semantic properties, such as materials and colors. Modeling and storing these properties indicating the relationships between them is best handled in a relational database.</p>\n\n<p>Database management systems (DBMSs) are a well-established solution when it comes to archiving, filtering, analysis, and correlation of large data collections. Ability to perform analysis near data is one of the key requirements identified by the 4th Paradigm to handle the data deluge.

The aim of this project is to develop and mature the spatial features of the column-store open-source MonetDB. It has established a track record in high-performance analytical applications and demonstrated its ability to inject database technology successfully in several science domains, such as astronomy, remote sensing, seismology, and navigation.</p>\n\n<p>The technology will be applied to a concrete use case of the Port of Rotterdam in which a 3D GIS is built to aid various multi-stakeholder construction projects where new structures are built in, on top of and around the existing port (underground) infrastructure. Extending and modifying the port is challenging as it is home to many different companies that often cover extensive areas and manage vast (underground) infrastructures such roads, pipes and cables. The port thus requires a 3D GIS that is able to store all harbor assets and analyze existing assets with future interventions and detect conflicts. The 3D GIS currently being built is aimed at collecting data from different sources and formats (BIM and GIS) and converting it to a common format to enable 3D operations and analyses such as 3D intersections, 3D buffers as well as simplification and generalization of GIS and (especially) BIM models for visualization purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The goals of the strategic partnership and the expected project outcome is as follows: database extension for storage and indexing of 3D point clouds with properties that are suitable for and take advantage of column-oriented internal data organization; database extension for storage and indexing of 3Dvoxels with properties that are suitable for and take advantage of column-storage; the extensions will be evaluated with data and processing requirements of the use case of port of Rotterdam.</p>\n\n<p>The development will rely as much as possible on existing open-source tools and libraries. The proposed (geo-) spatial data analytics tools will extend the eScience Technology Platform (eSTeP) and be offered as an associated technology available to the NLeSC projects and other eScience projects in national and international context.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>Time-domain astronomy opens up a new era of observational astronomy, covering the spectrum from radio and millimeter to optical wavelengths. The data avalanches from their instruments forces us to overhaul contemporary data storage, data management, and data analytics techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than endlessly piling observations onto fleets of hard drives, raw observations could be replaced with more compact model-based representations founded in astrophysics. A well-fitting model has the potential of reducing the storage footprint by several orders of magnitude. The result should, however, be still easy to query and amendable for further analysis within a priori known statistical bounds.</p>\n\n<p>The scientific challenge is to find efficient algorithms to fit many statistical models in millions of seemingly independent observations. Their representation should provide the means to control the information loss that may result from statistical compression, as added noise could destroy effects to be discovered at a later stage in the data analytics pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>In the LOFAR Transients Key Science project a database management infrastructure is in place to take the output of the image production pipeline to populate the LOFAR catalog. This database is expected to grow at a rate of 50TB per year. One of the key limitations of such sizeable databases in the context of data exploration is the time to scan the data for events of interest. The scientist needs to learn what to ask.</p>\n\n<p>One way to improve the exploration phase is to exploit the statistical properties of the growing collection of observations and semantically compress them into parameterized formulae. An astrophysical object with a stable light curve can be replaced by its average flux and a Gaussian error dispersion model. Periodicallly varying objects can be classified and represented by deterministic components of their signal wave models.</p>\n\n<p>The eScience technology addressed is primarily aimed at Optimized Data Handling with a drive to cut down the cost of Big Data Analytics through proper (continuous) preprocessing of the observational data. The existing open-source database system MonetDB, supporting the LOFAR transient database, is extended.</p>\n\n<p>The particular approach towards semantic driven database compression, in combination with the Blaeu visual data exploration tool developed at CWI, is likely to open a vista of hitherto unseen approaches to understand and explain the characteristics of the astrophysical objects. The strong embedding in LOFAR, BlackGem and emerging SKA infrastructures secure a direct route towards scientific discoveries by the astronomers engaged.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>The ERA-URBAN project takes up this eScience challenge and develops an environmental re-analysis on the scale of the urban environment; a long-term archive of urban energy and water balances at very high resolution (100m). Developing such an archive is now feasible as a direct and immediate extension of the (modelling and observational) infrastructure that has been built within NLeSC’s Summer in the City project.</p>\n\n<p>Summer in the City aims at forecasting urban weather and climate on a scale of 100 m using a detailed atmospheric model. It concentrates on two cities, Amsterdam and Wageningen, each studied in detail for one summer period. Generalizing its approach to multiple cities and extending its scope to precipitation and water balance is a next logical step as it allows the systematic and consistent study of urban hydrometeorological properties among cities in different climate types and local climate zones. This also allows to explore different characteristics of the landscape surrounding the urban areas, which is a prerequisite for answering urgent, currently open research questions.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of ERA-URBAN is to make the data in the long-term archive meaningful, insightful and useful for scientists, local-scale urban planners, policy makers, (local) companies and individual citizens. This requires a high performance computing effort by multi-model simulations, combined with data-assimilation of large volume multi-source hydrometeorological observations.</p>\n\n<p>Business partners in wind energy and water management will explore the practical applicability of ERA-URBAN, which will be made publically available for use in science, engineering, and consultancy.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>An eScience infrastructure for Bayesian inverse modeling</p>\n\n<p>We have developed a parallel MATLAB version of SODA (Vrugt et al., 2005) that makes use of MPI. The software package is called ‘The MMSODA Toolbox for MATLAB’, or MMSODA for short (MMSODA stands for MATLAB-MPI-SODA).</p>\n\n<p>MMSODA offers the functionality of a number of previously separate softwares, namely SCEM-UA (Vrugt <em>et al</em>., 2003b), SODA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2005a,b; Clark and Vrugt, 2006), MOSCEM-UA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2003a), multi-objective SODA (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2008), the MPITB-parallel version of SCEM-UA implemented in Octave (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2006b), and the MPITB-parallel version of SODA implemented in Octave (Vrugt <em>et al.</em>, 2006a). Additionally, MMSODA offers a parallel version of multi-objective SCEM-UA, and a parallel version of multi-objective SODA, both of which did not exist previously. Moreover, MMSODA does not use Octave when running in parallel, because Octave does not evaluate code as quickly as does MATLAB. MMSODA circumvents (in a legal fashion) the license requirements that are often an impediment to parallel computation by compiling the MATLAB code into a binary which can be run without any license. Compiling the binary, however, does require a license, both for the MATLAB program itself, as well as for the MATLAB Compiler Runtime Toolbox. Fortunately, the required licenses are available on most cluster environments targeting a scientific and engineering audience.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the acronyms mentioned above mean that: MMSODA can do parameter tuning with or without intermediate state updating by an ensemble Kalman Filter; that MMSODA supports both single-objective and multi-objective optimization; and that the optimization can be run either sequentially on a local machine, or in parallel on a cluster computer.</p>\n\n<p>The serial/parallel capability is particularly attractive, since it allows the users to set up their optimizations locally on their own machines, thus ensuring a familiar development environment without the need to make the code compatible with Octave syntax. When the user finishes setting up the optimization, running it on a cluster computer is simply a matter of copying the relevant directory to the cluster storage using standard tools (e.g. WinSCP) and compiling the software by executing a script that comes with the software. Furthermore, MMSODA is fully documented with HTML documentation which can be accessed in the same way as MATLAB’s built-in commands, namely through the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">doc</code> command.</p>\n\n<p><em>References</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>J.

There are two parts to this contribution: 1)\nin contrast to related work on emotion mining, our emotion model is more complex\n(i.e., contains many more labels (42 instead of 6 or 8)), and 2) related work on\nemotion/sentiment mining uses modern and mostly web-based texts. The historical\ntexts used in the embodied emotions project pose specific challenges (spelling\nvariation and the lack of NLP tools that work on historical text).\nThese results were published in IEEE eScience 2015.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Select (and prepare) corpus</li>\n  <li>Create annotation schema</li>\n  <li>Annotate texts</li>\n  <li>Compare manual annotation to existing sentiment mining techniques</li>\n  <li>Do machine learning with annotated texts and analyze the results</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A lot of time was spend on data selection and curation.

Existing work on emotion mining\nuses much simpler emotion models (6 to 8 labels). Details about the emotion model\ncan be found in the IEEE eScience paper and the domain papers.</p>\n\n<p>The annotation corpus was annotated by domain experts. To check the consistency\nand reliability of the annotations, an inter-annotator study was carried out.\nThe results of this study show that annotating texts using our annotation scheme\nwas quite difficult.

We experimented with two\nalgorithms for multi-label classification: Binary Relevance (BR) and\nRandom k-Labelsets (RAkEL). Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) using\nstandard bag-of-words features with tf-idf weighting and stop\nword removal were trained for both classification algorithms.\nWe also experimented with spelling normalization. More details about our method\nand results can be found in the IEEE eScience paper.</p>\n\n<p>The text classifiers trained were applied to a corpus of 250 texts.

      "description": "<p>Aerial imagery over urban areas is increasingly being used to provide detailed imagery and 3D models to support many applications such as map updating, urban planning and water management. The size of such photogrammetric projects is increasing rapidly, causing a scramble for hardware with more memory and processing power. A conventional UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flight can collect thousands of images and conventional photogrammetric sensors can acquire images of more than 200 Megapixels in size.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, the need of high performance hardware represents one of the main bottlenecks in the development of efficient automated applications exploiting photogrammetry over large areas. This Path-Finding Project will implement three tools for processing of large datasets able to run on consumer-grade computers.</p>\n\n<p>Two case studies are used to test the developed tools. The first considers how to make photogrammetric workflows accessible to end-users lacking advanced hardware, such as city planners in developing countries. In 2015, 16.000 images covering 150 hectare were collected over informal settlements in Kigali, Rwanda using a low-cost UAV. To analyze the potential of UAVs to provide accurate geo-information to support informal settlement upgrading projects, the workflow should be completed using consumer-grade computers.</p>\n\n<p>The second case study is related to mapping applications. Recently, projects have been developed to update national 3D models, for example the Dutch digital height model (AHN), through DIM from aerial images. The goal is to automatically process this enormous block using a consumer-grade PC. The dataset over Rotterdam will be used for this task.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>We are witnessing an increased significance of point clouds for societal and scientific applications, such as in smart cities, 3D urban modeling, flood modeling, dike monitoring, forest mapping, and digital object preservation in history and art. Modern Big Data acquisition technologies, such as laser scanning from airborne, mobile, or static platforms, dense image matching from photos, or multi-beam echo-sounding, have the potential to generate point clouds with billions (or even trillions) of elevation/depth points. One example is the height map of the Netherlands (the  AHN2 dataset), which consists of no less than 640.000.000.000 height values.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem with these point clouds is that they are simply too big (several terabytes) to be handled efficiently by common ICT infrastructures. At this moment researchers are unable to use this point cloud Big Data to its full potential because of a lack of tools for data management, dissemination, processing, and visualization.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is a scalable (more data and users without architectural change) and generic solution: keep all current standard object-relational database management system (DBMS) and integrate with existing spatial vector and raster data functionality. Core support for point cloud data types in the DBMS is needed, besides the existing vector and raster data types. Furthermore, a new and specific web-services protocol for point cloud data is investigated, supporting progressive transfer based on multi-resolution. Based on user requirements analysis a point cloud benchmark is specified. Oracle, PostgreSQL, MonetDB and file based solutions are analyzed and compared. After identifying weaknesses in existing DBMSs, R&amp;D activities will be conducted in order to realize improved solutions, in close cooperation with the various DBMS developers. The non-academic partners in this project (Rijkswaterstaat, Fugro and Oracle) will deliver their services and expertise and provide access to data and software (development).</p>\n"

The research will provide a decision support infrastructure for three case studies - the Relationship between the Urban Poor and the City in an Increasingly Urbanizing World; Dense City Infectious Disease Pressure; and Evacuation Strategies in Case of Emergencies. In the last case study for example, geographical information system data about the road network in the city will be collected, along with spatial data from the different emergency services, and the capabilities of the emergency services (for example for hospitals: specialty of the hospital, number of beds, number of ambulances, etc.). This will then have to be overlaid with the traffic data we wish to collect through the traffic authorities in the city.</p>\n"

It is an\ninterface to an Elasticsearch index (specifically, an ES index containing the\nKB newspaper archive from 1850 - 1990) that allows users to perform full text\nsearches and to visualize the results (in word clouds and/or time lines).\nTexcavator was build on top of previous applications (WAHSP and Biland).\nThe goals of this project were:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Improvement of the overall stability and maintainability of the software</li>\n  <li>Analysis and improvement of scalability</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Most time was spend on refactoring the back end. The quality of the original\nTexcavator software was very low; it was clearly organically grown (instead of\nengineered) and documentation and unit tests were lacking.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main problems was scalability of word cloud generation.\nIn the old version of Texcavator, this could take hours (even though the\nmaximum number of documents was limited to 10000 documents) and often failed\nwithout giving an error message.\nWe wanted to use standard Elasticsearch functionality to generate the word\nclouds (i.e., terms aggregations). However, this proved to be infeasible,\nbecause of the large amount of words in the data set (the number of unique\nwords in the corpus is too big (mostly due to OCR mistakes) to keep in memory,\nwhich is required to be able to use terms aggregations). We came up with two\nalternative approaches: term vector word clouds and tag word clouds and\nimplemented the term vector word clouds. Word cloud generation is now faster\n(minutes instead of hours).</p>\n\n<p>After the test version of Texcavator was put online, a user session was\norganized to test the performance of Texcavator when multiple users use the\napplication at the same time and to identify other problems with the\napplication. The session was a success in the sense that multiple users\n(~10) were able to use the application at the same time without noticable\neffects on performance (Texcavator remained responsive).</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>The “Mapping the Via Appia” project aims at a thorough inventory and analysis of the Roman interventions in this suburban landscape. The research focuses on a section of two kilometers that covers parts of the fifth and sixth miles of the Via Appia, supplemented with a research area that covers the hinterland as far as nearly one kilometer northeast and about 2.5 kilometers southwest of the road. Based on the physical remains in combination with historical sources, archaeologists aim to reconstruct the functioning of the road in antiquity. The study area contains more than 2000 archaeological objects directly alongside the road. The biggest difficulty for the archaeologists is that the archaeological remains are scattered alongside the road and often not in situ.</p>\n\n<p>In trying to interpret the “life” of these remains, the researchers document all the archaeological objects in the field in high detail; decorations, traces of erosion, cuts and location are considered to form key elements. However, in order to query this dataset systematically and to develop 3D reconstructions, the researchers need a 3D Geographic Information System. Being able to virtually explore the area in a 3D landscape and highlight attributive information given in the field provides tooling which aids the archaeologists to reconstruct the road. Show for example all objects that contain a specific type of marble and have a certain type of architectural feature dating to a specific period allows archaeologists to reconstruct the objects and their relationship to past landscapes. However, a 3D Information System in which highly detailed features can be stored, spatially analyzed, and integrated with conventional geospatial information has, due to the lack of computational power, not yet been produced for a complex research area.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to virtually explore the area in a 3D landscape and highlight attributive information given in the field provides tooling which aids the archaeologists to reconstruct the road.</p>\n\n<p>The Mapping the Via Appia project gives the opportunity to develop a 4D (3D + time) Geographic Information System for archaeological purposes. The use of a 4D GIS in archaeology is not yet widespread. 4D GIS in general is still very much in development, challenging this project to be progressive and innovative. The project aims to develop a highly detailed 4D GIS enabling archaeologists to analyze complex archaeological sites and landscapes.\nresults.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>Subjectivity and uncertainty form an integral part of Humanities research, sometimes even of the research object. Topics include subjectivity of authors (this chronicle’s writer is pro Burgundian), the nature of data (this chronicle likely mentions battles, but unlikely mentions raping and pillaging) and the time in which the data was created (‘a lot of people’ usually is summarised as “10.000 people” in the late Middle-Ages). Text dominantly reflects interpersonal and subjective points of view rather than objective facts. In addition, language is often imprecise or underspecified resulting in another level of subjectivity (for example spatial information is not well captured in language and perceptual values are expressed through scalar and relative words). Even humanities scholars aiming to be objective generally bring their own perspective and view of the past, a text tradition or painting.</p>\n\n<p>This project develops a tool that visualizes subjectivity, perspective and uncertainty to make them controllable variables. The tool allows users to compare information from different sources representing alternative perspectives and visualize subjectivity and uncertainty. Such a visualization enables improved and comprehensive source criticism, provides new directions of research and strengthens the methodology of digital humanities.</p>\n"

Whereas different EMH interventions tend to be equally effective, the responsiveness to a specific treatment shows large individual differences. The personalization of treatments is seen as the major road for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Because most EMH interventions use language for communication between counselors and clients, assessing language use provides an important avenue for opening the black box of what happens within therapy. EMH also makes data of the linguistic interactions between client and counselor available on an unprecedented large scale.

      "description": "<p>Oscar did Telecommunications Engineering in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona. Later on, he obtained a Master’s degree in Astrophysics, focusing in software engineering challenges in astronomical projects.</p>\n\n<p>Oscar’s background is development of software systems for the management, processing and analysis of Big Data. In the first years of his career, he was involved in astronomical projects. Initially in the development of a distributed analysis tool for the simulators of the ESA’s Gaia space mission. More recently, he was in charge of the data management of the LOFAR Epoch of Reionization project, which meant the development of a database system for the indexing of the petabyte-scale data handled by the project (among other things). The system, together with some additional tools, was used to ease the processing of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Oscar has realized that the skills acquired in astronomy projects can also be applied in many other areas that also fascinates him. That is the reason why he joined NLeSC in 2013. He has been the principal eScience researcher for several projects related to point cloud data, concretely “Massive point clouds for eScience”, “Mapping the Via Appia in 3D” and “Improving Open-Source Photogrammetric Workflows for Processing Big Datasets”. He also contributes to the eStep platform with libraries and knowledge for Geospatial analytics.</p>\n"

In 2008 Vincent moved to England to complete a PhD in Epidemiology at the MRC Epidemiology Unit within the University of Cambridge. Vincent did a post-doc at the Institute of Cellular Medicine within Newcastle University.</p>\n\n<p>Central theme of Vincent’s work has been the development of scientific software and algorithms to process data from wearable movement sensors. Vincent pioneered the analysis of data collected with human wrist-mounted high-resolution accelerometers that have been implemented since 2007 in population research on daily physical activity and sleep. Over the years Vincent published on various methodological issues relating to this topic. Further, Vincent has co-authored publications on the first large scale implementation of the technology by scientists in Brazil and the United Kingdom. He released his code as open access software in R package GGIR.</p>\n\n<p>Vincent joined the Netherlands eScience Center in 2015.</p>\n"

      "description": "<p>Historically, scientific domains were defined by their own unique tools (microscopes, telescopes, distillation glass). Nowadays, the most important tool in all scientific disciplines is the computer. In this digital era, eScience is the developing discipline that provides the domain overarching software instruments (software, workflows and protocols) to support diverse scientific initiatives - making possible the creation of new, even unforeseen, applications - with the potential to transform current scientific practice, optimize scientific investments and significantly accelerate scientific discovery. eScience has the potential to underpin all scientific endeavor in the same way that applied mathematics currently does.</p>\n\n<p>The Netherlands eScience Center (NLeSC) is tasked with coordinating a collaborative scientific program, working with both academia and industry, to conduct funded projects fostering the development of overarching tools for the benefit of a broad scientific community. The success of NLeSC will be measurable by the growing adoption of eScience tools as a fundamental approach within diverse research domains. Based on its multidisciplinary collaborations and technological advances, NLeSC aims to become recognized as one of the leading eScience expertise centers in the world.</p>\n"
